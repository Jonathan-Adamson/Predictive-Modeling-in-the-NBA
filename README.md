### Purpose
This project aims to create a deep-learning model that accurately forecasts All-NBA team in a given season. I want to know what is a better indicator of a player being chosen for the team: the player's in-season performance or their team's success. 

### Data
Data for this project will be web-scraped from Basketball-Reference.com a public source that provides detailed data on player performance and team performance dating back to 1946 and up to the present day. 

### Code
The code that has been written throughout the process of this research will be uploaded to the repository regularly. 

### Findings
Once completed, findings will also be uploaded to the repository.
