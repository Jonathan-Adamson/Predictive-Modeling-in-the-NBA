### Purpose
This project goes into the realm of sports analytics, focusing on predictive modeling in the context of NBA basketball. By leveraging a diverse range of methods adaptable to specific contexts, the study aims to forecast the All-NBA team and examine the significance of personal versus team statistics in the selection process. Through an approach utilizing Python for data preprocessing, R for advanced statistical analyses, and incorporating regression and deep learning techniques, the research looks to enhance the accuracy of predictive models. The logistic regression analysis reveals statistically significant predictors such as points scored, field goal percentage, blocks, assists, rebounds, and steals, shedding light on the key performance indicators influencing player recognition in the NBA. The study addresses existing knowledge gaps by integrating player-level data and advancing methodological approaches in predictive analytics. While the findings contribute to the strategic advantages available to technical staff, coaches, and analysts in optimizing player performance evaluation and team composition, limitations in data sourcing and variable selection are acknowledged. The results offer valuable insights for future research directions in sports analytics and predictive modeling, paving the way for further advancements in understanding player performance and game outcomes in professional basketball.

### Data
For this project, the data I used is a collection of basketball statistics sourced from basketball-reference.com. It is a widely recognized online platform that serves as a comprehensive database and statistical resource for basketball enthusiasts, offering detailed information on player and team performance, historical data, and advanced analytics, making it a valuable resource for fans, analysts, and researchers in the basketball community. Data is available in the folder DA_401_Data.

### Code
The code that has been written throughout the process of this research in both Python and R is located within the repository under DA_401_Code.
